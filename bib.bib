clustering in universes dominated by weakly interacting, 'cold' dark
matter are presented. The numerical methods used and the way in which
initial conditions were generated are described, and the simulations
performed are catalogued. The evolution of the fundamental statistical
properties of the models is described and their comparability with
observation is discussed. Graphical comparisons of these open models
with the observed galaxy distribution in a large redshift survey are
made. It is concluded that a model with a cosmological density parameter
omega equal to one is quite unacceptable if galaxies trace the mass
distribution, and that models with omega of roughly two, while better,
still do not provide a fully acceptable match with observation. Finally,
a situation in which galaxy formation is suppressed except in
sufficiently dense regions is modelled which leads to models which can
agree with observation quite well even for omega equal to one.},

	abstract = {We simulate the assembly of a massive rich cluster and the formation of its constituent galaxies in a flat, low-density universe. Our most accurate model follows the collapse, the star formation history and the orbital motion of all galaxies more luminous than the Fornax dwarf spheroidal, while dark halo structure is tracked consistently throughout the cluster for all galaxies more luminous than the SMC. Within its virial radius this model contains about 2{\texttimes}107 dark
matter particles and almost 5000 distinct dynamically resolved galaxies. Simulations of this same cluster at a variety of resolutions allow us to check explicitly for numerical convergence both of the dark matter structures produced by our new parallel N-body and substructure
identification codes, and of the galaxy populations produced by the phenomenological models we use to follow cooling, star formation, feedback and stellar aging. This baryonic modelling is tuned so that our simulations reproduce the observed properties of isolated spirals outside clusters. Without further parameter adjustment our simulations then produce a luminosity function, a mass-to-light ratio, luminosity, number and velocity dispersion profiles, and a morphology-radius relation which are similar to those observed in real clusters. In particular, since our simulations follow galaxy merging explicitly, we can demonstrate that it accounts quantitatively for the observed cluster population of bulges and elliptical galaxies.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF), a 1 million s exposure of an 11 arcmin2 region in the southern sky with the Advanced Camera for Surveys on the Hubble Space Telescope using Director's Discretionary Time. The exposure time was divided among four filters, F435W (B435), F606W (V606), F775W (i 775), and F850LP (z850), to give approximately uniform limiting magnitudes mAB ∼ 29 for point sources. The image contains at least 10,000 objects, presented here as a catalog, the vast majority of which are galaxies. Visual inspection of the images shows few if any galaxies at redshifts greater than ∼4 that resemble present-day spiral or elliptical galaxies. The image reinforces the conclusion from the original Hubble Deep Field that galaxies evolved strongly during the first few billion years in the infancy of the universe. Using the Lyman break dropout method to derive samples of galaxies at redshifts between 4 and 7, it is possible to study the apparent evolution of the galaxy luminosity function and number density. Examination of the catalog for dropout sources yields 504 B435 dropouts, 204 V 606 dropouts, and 54 i775 dropouts. The i775 dropouts are most likely galaxies at redshifts between 6 and 7. Using these samples, which are at different redshifts but derived from the same data, we find no evidence for a change in the characteristic luminosity of galaxies but some evidence for a decrease in their number densities between redshifts of 4 and 7. Assessing the factors needed to derive the luminosity function from the data suggests that there is considerable uncertainty in parameters from samples discovered with different instruments and derived using independent assumptions about the source populations. This assessment calls into question some of the strong conclusions of recently published work on distant galaxies. The ultraviolet luminosity density of these samples is dominated by galaxies fainter than the characteristic luminosity, and the HUDF reveals considerably more luminosity than shallower surveys. The apparent ultraviolet luminosity density of galaxies appears to decrease from redshifts of a few to redshifts greater than 6, although this decrease may be the result of faint-end incompleteness in the most distant samples. The highest redshift samples show that star formation was already vigorous at the earliest epochs at which galaxies have been observed, less than 1 billion years after the big bang.}

In particular we discuss the difference between integral and differential representations of the fluid equations in an SPH context and how this relates to the formulation of dissipative terms for the capture of shocks and other discontinuities. This has important implications for many problems, in particular related to recently highlighted problems in treating Kelvin{\textendash}Helmholtz instabilities across entropy gradients in SPH. The specific problems pointed out by Agertz et al. [O. Agertz, B. Moore, J. Stadel, D. Potter, F. Miniati, J. Read, L. Mayer, A. Gawryszczak, A. Kravtsov, {\r A}. Nordlund, F. Pearce, V. Quilis, D.

We propose a new formulation of artificial thermal conductivity in SPH which minimises dissipation away from discontinuities and can therefore be applied quite generally in SPH calculations.},

            160 bands. These remarkable data reach ∼1.5 AB mag deeper than the previous data over the HUDF, and now are an excellent match to the HUDF optical ACS data. For our search criteria, we use a two-color Lyman break selection technique to identify z ∼ 8-8.5Y
            105-dropouts. We find five likely z ∼ 8-8.5 candidates. The sources have H
            160-band magnitudes of ∼28.3 AB mag and very blue UV-continuum slopes, with a median estimated β of ≲–2.5 (where f
            λ ∝ λβ). This suggests that z ∼ 8 galaxies are not only essentially dust free but also may have very young ages or low metallicities. The observed number of Y
            105-dropout candidates is smaller than the 20 ± 6 sources expected assuming no evolution from z ∼ 6, but is consistent with the five expected extrapolating the Bouwens et al. luminosity function (LF) results to z ∼ 8. These results provide evidence that the evolution in the LF seen from z ∼ 7 to z ∼ 3 continues to z ∼ 8. The remarkable improvement in the sensitivity of WFC3/IR has enabled Hubble Space Telescope to cross a threshold, revealing star-forming galaxies at z∼ 8-9.}

	abstract = {The Spitzer Extended Deep Survey (SEDS) is a very deep infrared survey within five well-known extragalactic science fields: the UKIDSS Ultra-Deep Survey, the Extended Chandra Deep Field South, COSMOS, the Hubble Deep Field North, and the Extended Groth Strip. SEDS covers a total area of 1.46 deg2 to a depth of 26 AB mag (3σ) in both of the warm Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) bands at 3.6 and 4.5 μm. Because of its uniform depth of coverage in so many widely-separated fields, SEDS is subject to roughly 25% smaller errors due to cosmic variance than a single-field survey of the same size. SEDS was designed to detect and characterize galaxies from intermediate to high redshifts (z = 2-7) with a built-in means of assessing the impact of cosmic variance on the individual fields. Because the full SEDS depth was accumulated in at least three separate visits to each field, typically with six-month intervals between visits, SEDS also furnishes an opportunity to assess the infrared variability of faint objects. This paper describes the SEDS survey design, processing, and publicly-available data products. Deep IRAC counts for the more than 300,000 galaxies detected by SEDS are consistent with models based on known galaxy populations. Discrete IRAC sources contribute 5.6 ± 1.0 and 4.4 ± 0.8 nW m–2 sr–1 at 3.6 and 4.5 μm to the diffuse cosmic infrared background (CIB). IRAC sources cannot contribute more than half of the total CIB flux estimated from DIRBE data. Barring an unexpected error in the DIRBE flux estimates, half the CIB flux must therefore come from a diffuse component.}

	abstract = {The European Space Agency's Planck satellite, dedicated to studying the early Universe and its subsequent evolution, was launched 14 May 2009 and has been scanning the microwave and submillimetre sky continuously since 12 August 2009. In March 2013, ESA and the Planck Collaboration released the initial cosmology products based on the first 15.5 months of Planck data, along with a set of scientific and technical papers and a web-based explanatory supplement. This paper gives an overview of the mission and its performance, the processing, analysis, and
characteristics of the data, the scientific results, and the science data products and papers in the release. The science products include maps of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and diffuse extragalactic foregrounds, a catalogue of compact Galactic and extragalactic sources, and a list of sources detected through the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. The likelihood code used to assess cosmological models against the Planck data and a lensing likelihood are described. Scientific results include robust support for the standard six-parameter $\Lambda$CDM model of
cosmology and improved measurements of its parameters, including a highly significant deviation from scale invariance of the primordial power spectrum. The Planck values for these parameters and others derived from them are significantly different from those previously determined. Several large-scale anomalies in the temperature
distribution of the CMB, first detected by WMAP, are confirmed with higher confidence. Planck sets new limits on the number and mass of neutrinos, and has measured gravitational lensing of CMB anisotropies at greater than 25$\sigma$. Planck finds no evidence for non-Gaussianity in the CMB. Planck's results agree well with results from the measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations. Planck finds a lower Hubble constant than found in some more local measures. Some tension is also present between the amplitude of matter fluctuations ($\sigma$8)
derived from CMB data and that derived from Sunyaev-Zeldovich data. The Planck and WMAP power spectra are offset from each other by an average level of about 2\% around the first acoustic peak. Analysis of Planck polarization data is not yet mature, therefore polarization results are not released, although the robust detection of E-mode polarization around CMB hot and cold spots is shown graphically.},

We develop new color criteria that more optimally utilize the full wavelength coverage from the optical, near-IR, and mid-IR observations over our search fields, while simultaneously minimizing the incompleteness and eliminating redshift gaps. We have identified 5859, 3001, 857, 481, 217, and 6 galaxy candidates at , , , , , and , respectively, from the ∼1000 arcmin2 area covered by these data sets. This sample of >10,000 galaxy candidates at  is by far the largest assembled to date with HST. The selection of  4–8 candidates over the five CANDELS fields allows us to assess the cosmic variance; the largest variations are at . Our new LF determinations at  and  span a 6 mag baseline and reach to –16 AB mag. These determinations agree well with previous estimates, but the larger samples and volumes probed here result in a more reliable sampling of  galaxies and allow us to reassess the form of the UV LFs. Our new LF results strengthen our earlier findings to  significance for a steeper faint-end slope of the UV LF at , with α evolving from  at  to  at  (and  at ), consistent with that expected from the evolution of the halo mass function. We find less evolution in the characteristic magnitude M* from  to  the observed evolution in the LF is now largely represented by changes in . No evidence for a non-Schechter-like form to the z ∼ 4–8 LFs is found. A simple conditional LF model based on halo growth and evolution in the M/L ratio  of halos provides a good representation of the observed evolution.}

    abstract = "{We present the results of a new search for galaxies at redshift z ≃ 9 in the first two Hubble Frontier Fields with completed HST WFC3/IR and ACS imaging. To ensure robust photometric redshift solutions, and to minimize incompleteness, we confine our search to objects with H160 \\&lt; 28.6 (AB mag), consider only image regions with an rms noise σ160 \\&gt; 30 mag (within a 0.5-arcsec diameter aperture), and insist on detections in both H160 and J140. The result is a survey covering an effective area (after accounting for magnification) of 10.9 arcmin2, which yields 12 galaxies at 8.4 \\&lt; z \\&lt; 9.5. Within the Abell-2744 cluster and parallel fields, we confirm the three brightest objects reported by Ishigaki et al., but recover only one of the four z \\&gt; 8.4 sources reported by Zheng et al. In the MACSJ0416.1−240 cluster field, we report five objects, and explain why each of these eluded detection or classification as z ≃ 9 galaxies in the published searches of the shallower CLASH data. Finally, we uncover four z ≃ 9 galaxies from the MACSJ0416.1−240 parallel field. Based on the published magnification maps, we find that only one of these 12 galaxies is likely boosted by more than a factor of 2 by gravitational lensing. Consequently, we are able to perform a fairly straightforward reanalysis of the normalization of the z ≃ 9 UV galaxy luminosity function as explored previously in the HUDF12 programme. We conclude that the new data strengthen the evidence for a continued smooth decline in UV luminosity density (and hence star formation rate density) from z ≃ 8 to 9, contrary to recent reports of a marked drop-off at these redshifts. This provides further support for the scenario in which early galaxy evolution is sufficiently extended to explain cosmic reionization.}",

	abstract = {We have updated the Munich galaxy formation model to the Planck first-year cosmology, while modifying the treatment of baryonic processes to reproduce recent data on the abundance and passive fractions of galaxies from z = 3 down to z = 0. Matching these more extensive and more precise observational results requires us to delay the reincorporation of wind ejecta, to lower the surface density threshold for turning cold gas into stars, to eliminate ram-pressure stripping in haloes less massive than \~{}1014M?\~{}1014M?\{{\textbackslash}sim \}10{\textasciicircum}\{14\}\{{\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}, M\_\{\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\}\}, and to modify our model for radio mode feedback. These changes cure the most obvious failings of our previous models, namely the overly early formation of low-mass galaxies and the overly large fraction of them that are passive at late times. The new model is calibrated to reproduce the observed evolution both of the stellar mass function and of the distribution of star formation rate at each stellar mass. Massive galaxies (log M*/M? >= 11.0) assemble most of their mass before z = 1 and are predominantly old and passive at z = 0, while lower mass galaxies assemble later and, for log M*/M? <= 9.5, are still predominantly blue and star forming at z = 0. This phenomenological but physically based model allows the observations to be interpreted in terms of the efficiency of the various processes that control the formation and evolution of galaxies as a function of their stellar mass, gas content, environment and time.},

	abstract = {We present Hubble WFC3/IR slitless grism spectra of a remarkably bright z ≳ 10 galaxy candidate, GN-z11, identified initially from CANDELS/GOODS-N imaging data. A significant spectroscopic continuum break is detected at . The new grism data, combined with the photometric data, rule out all plausible lower redshift solutions for this source. The only viable solution is that this continuum break is the Lyα break redshifted to , just ∼400 Myr after the Big Bang. This observation extends the current spectroscopic frontier by 150 Myr to well before the Planck (instantaneous) cosmic reionization peak at z ∼ 8.8, demonstrating that galaxy build-up was well underway early in the reionization epoch at z > 10. GN-z11 is remarkably, and unexpectedly, luminous for a galaxy at such an early time: its UV luminosity is 3×  larger than  measured at z ∼ 6−8. The Spitzer IRAC detections up to 4.5 μm of this galaxy are consistent with a stellar mass of  ∼109 M⊙. This spectroscopic redshift measurement suggests that James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be able to similarly and easily confirm such sources at z > 10 and characterize their physical properties through detailed spectroscopy. Furthermore, WFIRST, with its wide-field near-IR imaging, would find large numbers of similar galaxies and contribute greatly to JWST's spectroscopy, if it is launched early enough to overlap with JWST.}

@article{McKinnon2016a,
abstract = {We present full volume cosmological simulations using the moving-mesh code AREPO to study the coevolution of dust and galaxies. We extend the dust model in AREPO to include thermal sputtering of grains and investigate the evolution of the dust mass function, the cosmic distribution of dust beyond the interstellar medium, and the dependence of dust-to-stellar mass ratio on galactic properties. The simulated dust mass function is well-described by a Schechter fit and lies closest to observations at {\$}z = 0{\$}. The radial scaling of projected dust surface density out to distances of {\$}10 \backslash, \backslashtext{\{}Mpc{\}}{\$} around galaxies with magnitudes {\$}17 {\textless} i {\textless} 21{\$} is similar to that seen in Sloan Digital Sky Survey data, albeit with a lower normalisation. At {\$}z = 0{\$}, the predicted dust density of {\$}\backslashOmega{\_}\backslashtext{\{}dust{\}} \backslashapprox 1.3 \backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}-6{\}}{\$} lies in the range of {\$}\backslashOmega{\_}\backslashtext{\{}dust{\}}{\$} values seen in low-redshift observations. We find that dust-to-stellar mass ratio anti-correlates with stellar mass for galaxies living along the star formation main sequence. Moreover, we estimate the {\$}850 \backslash, \backslashmu\backslashtext{\{}m{\}}{\$} number density functions for simulated galaxies and analyse the relation between dust-to-stellar flux and mass ratios at {\$}z = 0{\$}. At high redshift, our model fails to produce enough dust-rich galaxies, and this tension is not alleviated by adopting a top-heavy initial mass function. We do not capture a decline in {\$}\backslashOmega{\_}\backslashtext{\{}dust{\}}{\$} from {\$}z = 2{\$} to {\$}z = 0{\$}, which suggests that dust production mechanisms more strongly dependent on star formation may help to produce the observed number of dusty galaxies near the peak of cosmic star formation.},

  7 galaxies, we employ an alternate strategy using deep Spitzer/IRAC data. We identify z ∼ 7.1–9.1 galaxies by selecting z ≳ 6 galaxies from the HST CANDELS data that show quite red IRAC [3.6]−[4.5] colors, indicating strong [O iii]+Hβ lines in the 4.5 μm band. This selection strategy was validated using a modest sample for which we have deep Y-band coverage, and subsequently used to select the brightest z ≥ 7 sources. Applying the IRAC criteria to all HST-selected optical dropout galaxies over the full ∼900 arcmin2 of the CANDELS survey revealed four unusually bright z ∼ 7.1, 7.6, 7.9, and 8.6 candidates. The median [3.6]−[4.5] color of our selected z ∼ 7.1–9.1 sample is consistent with rest-frame [O iii]+Hβ EWs of ∼1500 Å in the [4.5] band. Keck/MOSFIRE spectroscopy has been independently reported for two of our selected sources, showing Lyα at redshifts of 7.7302 ± 0.0006 and , respectively. We present similar Keck/MOSFIRE spectroscopy for a third selected galaxy with a probable 4.7σ Lyα line at z
spec = 7.4770 ± 0.0008. All three have H160-band magnitudes of ∼25 mag and are ∼0.5 mag more luminous (M
1600 ∼ −22.0) than any previously discovered z ∼ 8 galaxy, with important implications for the UV luminosity function (LF). Our three brightest and highest redshift z > 7 galaxies all lie within the CANDELS-EGS field, providing a dramatic illustration of the potential impact of field-to-field variance.}

	abstract = {The deep, wide-area (∼800–900 arcmin2) near-infrared/WFC3/IR + Spitzer/IRAC observations over the CANDELS fields have been a remarkable resource for constraining the bright end of high-redshift UV luminosity functions. However, the lack of Hubble Space Telescope (HST)  1.05 μm observations over the CANDELS fields has made it difficult to identify z ∼ 9–10 sources robustly, since such data are needed to confirm the presence of an abrupt Lyman break at 1.2 μm. Here, we report on the successful identification of many such z ∼ 9–10 sources from a new HST program (z9-CANDELS) that targets the highest-probability z ∼ 9–10 galaxy candidates with observations at 1.05 μm, to search for a robust Lyman-break at 1.2 μm. The potential z ∼ 9–10 candidates were preselected from the full HST, Spitzer/IRAC S-CANDELS observations, and the deepest-available ground-based optical+near-infrared observations (CFHTLS-DEEP+HUGS+UltraVISTA+ZFOURGE). We identified 15 credible z ∼ 9–10 galaxies over the CANDELS fields. Nine of these galaxies lie at z ∼ 9 and five are new identifications. Our targeted follow-up strategy has proven to be very efficient in making use of scarce HST time to secure a reliable sample of z ∼ 9–10 galaxies. Through extensive simulations, we replicate the selection process for our sample (both the preselection and follow-up) and use it to improve current estimates for the volume density of bright z ∼ 9 and z ∼ 10 galaxies. The volume densities we find are 5 and  lower, respectively, than those found at z ∼ 8. When compared with the best-fit evolution (i.e., ) in the UV luminosity densities from z ∼ 8 to z ∼ 4 integrated to  (−20 mag), these luminosity densities are  and  lower, respectively, than the extrapolated trends. Our new results are broadly consistent with the “accelerated evolution” scenario at z > 8, consistent with that seen in many models.}

    abstract = "{We employ the very large cosmological hydrodynamical simulation BlueTides to investigate the predicted properties of the galaxy population during the epoch of reionization (z \\&gt; 8). BlueTides has a resolution and volume ((400/h ≈ 577)3 cMpc3) providing a population of galaxies that is well matched to depth and area of current observational surveys targeting the high-redshift Universe. At z = 8, BlueTides includes almost 160 000 galaxies with stellar masses \\&gt;108 M⊙. The population of galaxies predicted by BlueTides closely matches observational constraints on both the galaxy stellar mass function and far-UV (150 nm) luminosity function. Galaxies in BlueTides are characterized by rapidly increasing star formation histories. Specific star formation rates decrease with redshift though remain largely insensitive to stellar mass. As a result of the enhanced surface density of metals, more massive galaxies are predicted to have higher dust attenuation resulting in a significant steepening of the observed far-UV luminosity function at high luminosities. The contribution of active supermassive black holes (SMBHs) to the UV luminosities of galaxies with stellar masses 109–10 M⊙ is around 3 per cent on average. Approximately 25 per cent of galaxies with M* ≈ 1010 M⊙ are predicted to have active SMBHs that contribute \\&gt;10 per cent of the total UV luminosity.}",

	journal = {\apj},
	abstract = {We use the largest sample of  galaxies to date from the first four Hubble Frontier Fields clusters to set constraints on the shape of the  luminosity functions (LFs) to fainter than  mag. We quantify, for the first time, the impact of magnification uncertainties on LF results and thus provide more realistic constraints than other recent work. Our simulations reveal that, for the highly magnified sources, the systematic uncertainties can become extremely large fainter than −14 mag, reaching several orders of magnitude at 95% confidence at approximately −12 mag. Our new forward-modeling formalism incorporates the impact of magnification uncertainties into the LF results by exploiting the availability of many independent magnification models for the same cluster. One public magnification model is used to construct a mock high-redshift galaxy sample that is then analyzed using the other magnification models to construct an LF. Large systematic errors occur at high magnifications () because of differences between the models. The volume densities we derive for faint (≳−17 mag) sources are ∼3–4× lower than one recent report and give a faint-end slope , which is 3.0–3.5σ shallower (including or not including the size uncertainties, respectively). We introduce a new curvature parameter δ to model the faint end of the LF and demonstrate that the observations permit (at 68% confidence) a turn-over at  in the range of −15.3 to −14.2 mag, depending on the assumed lensing model. The present consideration of magnification errors and new size determinations raise doubts about previous reports regarding the form of the LF at . We discuss the implications of our turn-over constraints in the context of recent theoretical predictions.}

Through the refined spectral energy distributions, which now also include new HyperSuprimeCam g-, r-, i-, z-, and Y-band data, we confirm that 3/5 galaxies have robust , consistent with the initial selection.

We measure mean UV continuum slopes  for the three  galaxies, marginally bluer than similarly luminous  in CANDELS but consistent with previous measurements of similarly luminous galaxies at . The circularized effective radius for our brightest source is 0.9 ± 0.3 kpc, similar to previous measurements for a bright  galaxy and bright  galaxies.

These are the largest samples hitherto and reach down to the faint ends of recently obtained deep luminosity functions. At faint magnitudes, however, these samples are highly incomplete for galaxies with large sizes, implying that derivation of the luminosity function sensitively depends on the intrinsic size–luminosity relation. We thus conduct simultaneous maximum-likelihood estimation of luminosity function and size–luminosity relation parameters from the observed distribution of galaxies on the size–luminosity plane with the help of a completeness map as a function of size and luminosity. At z ∼ 6–7, we find that the intrinsic size–luminosity relation expressed as r
e ∝ L

β
 has a notably steeper slope of  than those at lower redshifts, which in turn implies that the luminosity function has a relatively shallow faint-end slope of . This steep β can be reproduced by a simple analytical model in which smaller galaxies have lower specific angular momenta. The β and α values for the z ∼ 8 and 9 samples are consistent with those for z ∼ 6–7 but with larger errors. For all three samples, there is a large, positive covariance between β and α, implying that the simultaneous determination of these two parameters is important. We also provide new strong lens mass models of Abell S1063 and Abell 370, as well as updated mass models of Abell 2744 and MACS J0416.1−2403.}

	abstract = {We present an analysis of all prime HST legacy fields spanning >800 arcmin2 in the search for z ∼ 10 galaxy candidates and the study of their UV luminosity function (LF). In particular, we present new z ∼ 10 candidates selected from the full Hubble Frontier Field (HFF) data set. Despite the addition of these new fields, we find a low abundance of z ∼ 10 candidates with only nine reliable sources identified in all prime HST data sets that include the HUDF09/12, the HUDF/XDF, all of the CANDELS fields, and now the HFF survey. Based on this comprehensive search, we find that the UV luminosity function decreases by one order of magnitude from z ∼ 8 to z ∼ 10 over a four-magnitude range. This also implies a decrease of the cosmic star formation rate density by an order of magnitude within 170 Myr from z ∼ 8 to z ∼ 10. We show that this accelerated evolution compared to lower redshift can entirely be explained by the fast build up of the dark matter halo mass function at z > 8. Consequently, the predicted UV LFs from several models of galaxy formation are in good agreement with this observed trend, even though the measured UV LF lies at the low end of model predictions. The difference is generally still consistent within the Poisson and cosmic variance uncertainties. We discuss the implications of these results in light of the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope mission, which is poised to find much larger samples of z ∼ 10 galaxies as well as their progenitors at less than 400 Myr after the big bang.},

Compared to the case in which only dust production in stellar ejecta is active, if we include processes occurring in the cold ISM, the dust content is enhanced by a factor 2–3. However, the dust properties in this stage turn out to be significantly different from those observationally derived for the average Milky Way dust, and commonly adopted in calculations of dust reprocessing. We show that these differences may have a strong impact on the predicted spectral energy distributions. At low redshift in star-forming regions our model reproduces reasonably well the trend of dust abundances over metallicity as observed in local galaxies. However we underproduce by a factor of 2–3 the total dust content of clusters estimated observationally at low redshift, \\$z\\$ ≲ 0.5 using IRAS, Planck, and Herschel satellites data. This discrepancy does not subsist by assuming a lower sputtering efficiency, which erodes dust grains in the hot intracluster medium.}",

We also find again the z = 8.683 source previously confirmed by Zitrin et al. This brings our sample of probable z ∼ 9–11 galaxy candidates over the CANDELS+ERS fields to 19 sources in total, equivalent to one candidate per 47 arcmin2 (one per 10 WFC3/IR fields). To be comprehensive, we also discuss 28 mostly lower likelihood z ∼ 9–10 candidates, including some sources that seem to be reliably at z > 8 using the HST+IRAC data alone, but which the ground-based data show are much more likely at z  8, with a factor of ∼10 evolution seen in the luminosity density from z ∼ 10 to z ∼ 8.}

H
 < 25.5. Four of these objects were originally reported in Calvi et al. Combining new Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFC3/F814W imaging and Spitzer IRAC data with archival imaging from BoRG and other surveys, we explore the properties of these galaxies. Photometric redshift fitting places six of these galaxies in the redshift range of 7.1 < z < 8.0, resulting in three new high-redshift galaxies and confirming three of the four high-redshift galaxy candidates from Calvi et al. We calculate the half-light radii of the Super Eight galaxies using the HST F160W filter and find that the Super Eight sizes are in line with the typical evolution of size with redshift. The Super Eights have a mean mass of log (M
*/M
⊙) ∼10, which is typical for sources in this luminosity range. Finally, we place our sample on the UV z ∼ 8 luminosity function and find that the Super Eight number density is consistent with other surveys in this magnitude and redshift range.}

the radial distributions of stars and atomic and molecular gas in galaxy
discs. We include an H2-based star-formation law, as well as
a detailed chemical-enrichment model with explicit mass-dependent delay
times for SN-II, SN-Ia, and AGB stars. Information about the star
formation, feedback, and chemical-enrichment histories of discs is
stored in 12 concentric rings. The new model retains the success of its
predecessor in reproducing the observed evolution of the galaxy
population, in particular, stellar mass functions and passive fractions
over the redshift range 0 <= z <= 3 and mass range 8<= log
(M\_*/M\_\{?\})<= 12, the black hole-bulge mass relation at z = 0,
galaxy morphology as a function of stellar mass and the mass-metallicity
relations of both stellar and gas components. In addition, its detailed
modelling of the radial structure of discs allows qualitatively new
comparisons with observation, most notably with the relative sizes and
masses of the stellar, atomic, and molecular components in discs. Good
agreement is found with recent data. Comparison of results obtained for
simulations differing in mass resolution by more than two orders of
magnitude shows that all important distributions are numerically well
converged even for this more detailed model. An examination of
metallicity and surface-density gradients in the stars and gas indicates
that our new model, with star formation, chemical enrichment, and
feedback calculated self-consistently on local disc scales, reproduces
some but not all of the trends seen in recent many-galaxy IFU surveys.},

These comprise a suite of hydrodynamical simulations in a \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM cosmogony with subgrid models for radiative cooling, star formation, stellar mass loss, and feedback from stars and accreting black holes. The subgrid feedback was calibrated to reproduce the observed present-day galaxy stellar mass function and galaxy sizes. Here we demonstrate that the simulations reproduce the observed growth of the stellar mass density to within 20 per cent. The simulation also tracks the observed evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function out to redshift z = 7, with differences comparable to the plausible uncertainties in the interpretation of the data. Just as with observed galaxies, the specific star formation rates of simulated galaxies are bimodal, with distinct star forming and passive sequences. The specific star formation rates of star forming galaxies are typically 0.2 to 0.4 dex lower than observed, but the evolution of the rates track the observations closely. The unprecedented level of agreement between simulation and data makes EAGLE a powerful resource to understand the physical processes that govern galaxy formation.},

	abstract = {We present results from thirteen cosmological simulations that explore the parameter space of the "Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments" (EAGLE) simulation project. Four of the simulations follow the evolution of a periodic cube L = 50 cMpc on a side, and each employs a different subgrid model of the energetic feedback associated with star formation. The relevant parameters were adjusted so that the simulations each reproduce the observed galaxy stellar mass function at z = 0.1. Three of the simulations fail to form disc galaxies as extended as observed, and we show analytically that this is a consequence of numerical radiative losses that reduce the efficiency of stellar feedback in high-density gas. Such losses are greatly reduced in the fourth simulation - the EAGLE reference model - by injecting more energy in higher density gas. This model produces galaxies with the observed size distribution, and also reproduces many galaxy scaling relations. In the remaining nine simulations, a single parameter or process of the reference model was varied at a time. We find that the properties of galaxies with stellar mass {\textless}{\textasciitilde} M* (the "knee" of the galaxy stellar mass function) are largely governed by feedback associated with star formation, while those of more massive galaxies are also controlled by feedback from accretion onto their central black holes. Both processes must be efficient in order to reproduce the observed galaxy population. In general, simulations that have been calibrated to reproduce the low-redshift galaxy stellar mass function will still not form realistic galaxies, but the additional requirement that galaxy sizes be acceptable leads to agreement with a large range of observables.},

	abstract = {We introduce the Virgo Consortium's EAGLE project, a suite of hydrodynamical simulations that follow the formation of galaxies and black holes in representative volumes. We discuss the limitations of such simulations in light of their finite resolution and poorly constrained subgrid physics, and how these affect their predictive power. One major improvement is our treatment of feedback from massive stars and AGN in which thermal energy is injected into the gas without the need to turn off cooling or hydrodynamical forces, allowing winds to develop without predetermined speed or mass loading factors. Because the feedback efficiencies cannot be predicted from first principles, we calibrate them to the z{\textasciitilde}0 galaxy stellar mass function and the amplitude of the galaxy-central black hole mass relation, also taking galaxy sizes into account. The observed galaxy mass function is reproduced to \${\textbackslash}lesssim 0.2\$ dex over the full mass range, \$10{\textasciicircum}8 {\textless} M\_*/M\_{\textbackslash}odot {\textbackslash}lesssim 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}\$, a level of agreement close to that attained by semi-analytic models, and unprecedented for hydrodynamical simulations. We compare our results to a representative set of low-redshift observables not considered in the calibration, and find good agreement with the observed galaxy specific star formation rates, passive fractions, Tully-Fisher relation, total stellar luminosities of galaxy clusters, and column density distributions of intergalactic CIV and OVI. While the mass-metallicity relations for gas and stars are consistent with observations for \$M\_* {\textbackslash}gtrsim 10{\textasciicircum}9 M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, they are insufficiently steep at lower masses. The gas fractions and temperatures are too high for clusters of galaxies, but for groups these discrepancies can be resolved by adopting a higher heating temperature in the subgrid prescription for AGN feedback. EAGLE constitutes a valuable new resource for studies of galaxy formation.},

Our stellar mass functions have steep low-mass slopes ($\alpha$ ? -1.9), steeper than previously observed at these redshifts and closer to that of the UV luminosity function.

A mass-luminosity relation with strongly luminosity-dependent M/Luv ratios is found for the largest sample (299 galaxies) at z 4. The relation M {\textbackslash}propto L\_\{UV,1500\}{\textasciicircum}(1.7+/-0.2) has a well-determined intrinsic sample variance of 0.5 dex. This relation is also consistent with the more limited samples at z 5-7. This z 4 mass-luminosity relation, and the well-established faint UV luminosity functions at z 4-7, are used to derive galaxy mass functions (MF) to masses M{\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}8 at z 4-7. A bootstap approach is used to derive the MFs to account for the large scatter in the M--Luv relation and the luminosity function uncertainties, along with an analytical crosscheck. The MFs are also corrected for the effects of incompleteness. The incompleteness-corrected MFs are steeper than previously found, with slopes {\textbackslash}alpha\_M-1.4 to -1.6 at low masses. These slopes are, however, still substantially flatter than the MFs obtained from recent hydrodynamical simulations.

The regions have overdensities that deviate by (-2, -1, 0, +1, +2)sigma from the cosmic mean, where sigma is the rms mass fluctuation on a scale of {\textasciitilde}20Mpc/h at z=1.5. The simulations have mass resolution of up to 10{\textasciicircum}6 Msun/h, cover the entire range of large-scale environments and allow extrapolation of statistics to the entire 500 (Mpc/h){\textasciicircum}3 Millennium volume. They include gas cooling, photoheating from an ionising background, SNe feedback and winds, but no AGN. We find that the specific SFR density at z {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 10 varies systematically from region to region by up to an order of magnitude, but the global value, averaged over all volumes, reproduces observational data. Massive, compact galaxies, similar to those observed in the GOODS fields, form in the overdense regions as early as z=6, but do not appear in the underdense regions until z{\textasciitilde}3. These environmental variations are not caused by a dependence of the star formation properties on environment, but rather by a strong variation of the halo mass function from one environment to another, with more massive haloes forming preferentially in the denser regions. At all epochs, stars form most efficiently in haloes of circular velocity {\textasciitilde} 250 km/s. However, the star formation history exhibits a form of "downsizing" (even in the absence of AGN): the stars comprising massive galaxies at z=0 have mostly formed by z=1-2, whilst those comprising smaller galaxies typically form at later times. However, additional feedback is required to limit star formation in massive galaxies at late times.},

	abstract = {We review recent determinations of the present-day mass function (PDMF) and initial mass function (IMF) in various components of the
Galaxy-disk, spheroid, young, and globular clusters-and in conditions characteristic of early star formation. As a general feature, the IMF is found to depend weakly on the environment and to be well described by a power-law form for m{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}1 Msolar and a lognormal form below, except possibly for early star formation conditions. The disk IMF for single objects has a characteristic mass around mc{\textasciitilde}0.08 Msolar and a variance in logarithmic mass $\sigma${\textasciitilde}0.7,
whereas the IMF for multiple systems has mc{\textasciitilde}0.2
Msolar and $\sigma${\textasciitilde}0.6. The extension of the single MF into the brown dwarf regime is in good agreement with present estimates of L- and T-dwarf densities and yields a disk brown dwarf number density comparable to the stellar one, nBD{\textasciitilde}n*{\textasciitilde}0.1
pc-3. The IMF of young clusters is found to be consistent with the disk field IMF, providing the same correction for unresolved binaries, confirming the fact that young star clusters and disk field stars represent the same stellar population. Dynamical effects, yielding depletion of the lowest mass objects, are found to become consequential for ages {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}130 Myr. The spheroid IMF relies on much less robust
grounds. The large metallicity spread in the local subdwarf photometric sample, in particular, remains puzzling. Recent observations suggest that there is a continuous kinematic shear between the thick-disk population, present in local samples, and the genuine spheroid one. This enables us to derive only an upper limit for the spheroid mass density and IMF. Within all the uncertainties, the latter is found to be similar to the one derived for globular clusters and is well represented also by a lognormal form with a characteristic mass slightly larger than for the disk, mc{\textasciitilde}0.2-0.3 Msolar, excluding a significant population of brown dwarfs in globular clusters and in the spheroid. The IMF characteristic of early star formation at large redshift remains undetermined, but different observational constraints suggest that it does not extend below {\textasciitilde}1 Msolar. These results suggest a characteristic mass for star formation that decreases with time, from conditions prevailing at large redshift to conditions characteristic of the spheroid (or thick disk) to present-day conditions. These
conclusions, however, remain speculative, given the large uncertainties in the spheroid and early star IMF determinations.

These IMFs allow a reasonably robust determination of the Galactic present-day and initial stellar and brown dwarf contents. They also have important galactic implications beyond the Milky Way in yielding more accurate mass-to-light ratio determinations. The mass-to-light ratios obtained with the disk and the spheroid IMF yield values 1.8-1.4 times smaller than for a Salpeter IMF, respectively, in agreement with various recent dynamical determinations. This general IMF determination is examined in the context of star formation theory. None of the theories based on a Jeans-type mechanism, where fragmentation is due only to gravity, can fulfill all the observational constraints on star formation and predict a large number of substellar objects. On the other hand, recent numerical simulations of compressible turbulence, in particular in super-Alfv{\'e}nic conditions, seem to reproduce both
qualitatively and quantitatively the stellar and substellar IMF and thus provide an appealing theoretical foundation. In this picture, star formation is induced by the dissipation of large-scale turbulence to smaller scales through radiative MHD shocks, producing filamentary structures. These shocks produce local nonequilibrium structures with large density contrasts, which collapse eventually in gravitationally bound objects under the combined influence of turbulence and gravity. The concept of a single Jeans mass is replaced by a distribution of local Jeans masses, representative of the lognormal probability density function of the turbulent gas. Objects below the mean thermal Jeans mass still have a possibility to collapse, although with a decreasing probability.

Our results are consistent with observed galaxy stellar mass functions, specific star formation rates, and cosmic star formation rates from z=0 to z=8. We consider the effects of a wide range of uncertainties on our results, including those affecting stellar masses, star formation rates, and the halo mass function at the heart of our analysis. As they are relevant to our method, we also present new calibrations of the dark matter halo mass function, halo mass accretion histories, and halo-subhalo merger rates out to z=8. We also provide new compilations of cosmic and specific star formation rates; more recent measurements are now consistent with the buildup of the cosmic stellar mass density at all redshifts. Implications of our work include: halos near 10{\textasciicircum}12 Msun are the most efficient at forming stars at all redshifts, the baryon conversion efficiency of massive halos drops markedly after z {\textasciitilde} 2.5 (consistent with theories of cold-mode accretion), the ICL for massive galaxies is expected to be significant out to at least z {\textasciitilde} 1-1.5, and dwarf galaxies at low redshifts have higher stellar mass to halo mass ratios than previous expectations and form later than in most theoretical models. Finally, we provide new fitting formulae for star formation histories that are more accurate than the standard declining tau model. Our approach places a wide variety of observations relating to the star formation history of galaxies into a self-consistent framework based on the modern understanding of structure formation in LCDM.

We describe an updated, Bayesian spectral-energy distribution fitting method that incorporates effects of nebular line emission, star formation histories that are constant or rising with time, and different dust-attenuation prescriptions (starburst and Small Magellanic Cloud).

Our new LF determinations at z{\textasciitilde}4 and z{\textasciitilde}5 span a 6-mag baseline (-22.5 to -16 AB mag). These determinations agree well with previous estimates, but the larger samples and volumes probed here result in a more reliable sampling of {\textgreater}L* galaxies and allow us to reassess the form of the UV LFs. Our new LF results strengthen our earlier findings to 3.4 sigma significance for a steeper faint-end slope to the UV LF at z{\textgreater}4, with alpha evolving from alpha=-1.64+/-0.04 at z{\textasciitilde}4 to alpha=-2.06+/-0.13 at z{\textasciitilde}7 (and alpha = -2.02+/-0.23 at z{\textasciitilde}8), consistent with that expected from the evolution of the halo mass function. With our improved constraints at the bright end, we find less evolution in the characteristic luminosity M* over the redshift range z{\textasciitilde}4 to z{\textasciitilde}7; the observed evolution in the LF is now largely represented by changes in phi*. No evidence for a non-Schechter-like form to the z{\textasciitilde}4-8 LFs is found.

	abstract = {A growing number of galaxy clusters at z = 1-2 is being discovered as part of deep optical, IR, X-ray, and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect surveys. For a complete picture of cluster formation, however, it is important that we also start probing the much earlier epoch, between redshifts of about 2 and 7, during which these clusters and their galaxies first began to form. Because the study of these so-called proto-clusters is currently quite limited by small number statistics, widely varying selection techniques, and many assumptions, we have performed a large systematic study of cluster formation utilizing cosmological simulations. We use the Millennium Simulations to track the evolution of dark matter and galaxies in about 3000 clusters from the earliest times to z = 0. We define an effective radius R e for proto-clusters and characterize their growth in size and mass with cosmic time. We show that the progenitor regions of galaxy clusters (ranging in mass from 10 14 to a few times 10 15 M ? ) can already be identified in galaxy surveys at very early times (at least up to z 5), provided that the galaxy overdensities are measured on a sufficiently large scale ( R e 5-10 Mpc comoving) and with sufficient statistics. We present the overdensities in matter, dark matter halos, and galaxies as functions of present-day cluster mass, redshift, bias, and window size that can be used to interpret the wide range of structures found in real surveys. We also derive the probability that a structure having a galaxy overdensity $\delta$ gal , defined by a set of observational selection criteria, is indeed a proto-cluster, and we show how their z = 0 masses can already be estimated long before virialization. We present overdensity profiles as a function of radius, and we further show how the projected surface overdensities of proto-clusters decrease as the uncertainties in redshift measurements increase. We provide a table of proto-cluster candidates selected from the literature and discuss their properties in light of our simulation predictions. This paper provides the general framework that will allow us to extend the study of cluster formation out to much higher redshifts using the large number of proto-clusters that are expected to be discovered in, e.g., the upcoming HETDEX and Hyper Suprime-Cam surveys.},

	abstract = {We employ cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to investigate models 
in which the supermassive black holes powering luminous z \~{} 6
quasars (QSOs) grow from massive seeds. We simulate 18 regions with
densities ranging from the mean cosmic density to the highest $\sigma$
peaks in the Millennium simulation volume. Only in the most massive
haloes situated in the most overdense regions, can black holes grow to
masses up to ?109 M? by z \~{} 6 without
invoking super-Eddington accretion. Accretion on to the most massive
black holes becomes limited by thermal active galactic nucleus (AGN)
feedback by z \~{} 9-8 with further growth proceeding in short
Eddington-limited bursts. Our modelling suggests that current
flux-limited surveys of QSOs at high redshift preferentially detect
objects at their peak luminosity and therefore miss a substantial
population of QSOs powered by similarly massive black holes but with low
accretion rates. To test whether the required host halo masses are
consistent with the observed galaxy environments of z \~{} 6 QSOs, we
produce realistic rest-frame UV images of our simulated galaxies.
Without strong stellar feedback, our simulations predict numbers of
bright galaxies larger than observed by a factor of 10 or more.
Supernova-driven galactic winds reduce the predicted numbers to a level
consistent with observations indicating that stellar feedback was
already very efficient at high redshifts. We further investigate the
effect of thermal AGN feedback on the surrounding gas. AGN outflows are
highly anisotropic and mostly energy driven, pushing gas at ?1000
km s-1 out to tens of kpc consistently with observations. The
spatially extended thermal X-ray emission around bright QSOs is powered
by these outflows and is an important diagnostic of the mechanism
whereby AGN feedback energy couples to surrounding gas.},

If helium is predominantly in He II to begin with, both normalization (T0) and slope ($\gamma$) of the IGM effective equation-of-state get modified by the excess ionization from the quasars. Using the available
constraints on T0 at z \~{} 6, we discuss implications for the nature and epoch of H I and He II reionization. We study the extent of the He III region as a function of quasar age and show, for a typical inferred age of z \~{} 6 quasars (i.e. \~{}108 yr), it
extends up to 80 per cent of the H I proximity region. For these long lifetimes, the heating effects can be detected even when all the H I lines from the proximity region are used. Using the flux and curvature probability distribution functions (PDFs), we study the statistical detectability of heating effects as a function of initial physical conditions in the IGM. For the present sample size, cosmic variance dominates the flux PDF. The curvature statistics is more suited to capturing the heating effects beyond the cosmic variance, even if the sample size is half of what is presently available.},

	abstract = {Roughly half of all stars reside in galaxies without significant ongoing star formation. However, galaxy formation models indicate that it is energetically challenging to suppress the cooling of gas and the formation of stars in galaxies that lie at the centers of their dark matter halos. In this Letter, we show that the dependence of quiescence on black hole and stellar mass is a powerful discriminant between differing models for the mechanisms that suppress star formation. Using observations of 91 star-forming and quiescent central galaxies with directly-measured black hole masses, we find that quiescent galaxies host more massive black holes than star-forming galaxies with similar stellar masses. This observational result is in qualitative agreement with models that assume that effective, more-or-less continuous AGN feedback suppresses star formation, strongly suggesting the importance of the black hole in producing quiescence in central galaxies.},

	abstract = {We examine galaxy star formation rates (SFRs), metallicities, and gas contents predicted by the MUFASA cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, which employ meshless hydrodynamics and novel feedback prescriptions that yield a good match to observed galaxy stellar mass assembly. We combine 50, 25, and 12.5 Mpc/h boxes with a quarter billion particles each to show that MUFASA broadly reproduces a wide range of relevant observations, including SFR and specific SFR functions, the mass-metallicity relation, HI and H2 fractions, HI (21 cm) and CO luminosity functions, and cosmic gas density evolution. There are mild but significant discrepancies, such as too many high-SFR galaxies, overly metal-rich and HI-poor galaxies at M*{\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}\{10\} Mo, and sSFRs that are too low at z{\textasciitilde}1-2. The HI mass function increases by x2 out to z{\textasciitilde}1 then steepens to higher redshifts, while the CO luminosity function computed using the Narayanan et al. conversion factor shows a rapid increase of CO-bright galaxies out to z{\textasciitilde}2 in accord with data. Omega\_HI and Omega\_H2 both scale roughly as (1+z){\textasciicircum}0.7 out to z{\textasciitilde}3, comparable to the rise in HI and H2 fractions. MUFASA galaxies with high SFR at a given M* have lower metallicities and higher HI and H2 fractions, following observed trends; we make quantitative predictions for how fluctuations in the baryon cycle drive correlated scatter around galaxy scaling relations. Most of these trends are well converged with numerical resolution. These successes highlight MUFASA as a viable platform to study many facets of cosmological galaxy evolution.},

To assess its ability to predict halo correlations on large scales, we compare its results with those of an N-body simulation of a 3 h-1 Gpc box sampled with 20483 particles taken from the mice suite, matching the same seeds for the initial conditions. Thanks to the Fastest Fourier Transforms in the West (FFTW) libraries and to the relatively simple design, the code shows very good scaling properties. The CPU time required by pinocchio is a tiny fraction (\~{}1/2000) of that required by the mice simulation. Varying some of pinocchio numerical parameters allows one to produce a universal mass function that lies in the range allowed by published fits, although it underestimates the mice mass function of Friends-of-Friends (FoF) haloes in the high-mass tail. We compare the matter{\textendash}halo and the halo{\textendash}halo power spectra with those of the mice simulation and find that these two-point statistics are well recovered on large scales. In particular, when catalogues are matched in number density, agreement within 10 per cent is achieved for the halo power spectrum. At scales k {\textgreater} 0.1 h Mpc-1, the inaccuracy of the Zel{\textquoteright}dovich approximation in locating halo positions causes an underestimate of the power spectrum that can be modelled as a Gaussian factor with a damping scale of d = 3 h-1 Mpc at z = 0, decreasing at higher redshift. Finally, a remarkable match is obtained for the reduced halo bispectrum, showing a good description of non-linear halo bias. Our results demonstrate the potential of pinocchio as an accurate and flexible tool for generating large ensembles of mock galaxy surveys, with interesting applications for the analysis of large galaxy redshift surveys.},

The formation of massive black hole seeds via direct collapse with initial masses {\textasciitilde} 10{\textasciicircum}4 - 10{\textasciicircum}5 Msun alleviates this problem. Physical conditions required to form these massive direct collapse black hole (DCBH) seeds are available in the early universe. These viable DCBH formation sites, satellite halos of star-forming galaxies, merge and acquire a stellar component. These produce a new, transient class of objects at high redshift, Obese Black hole Galaxies (OBGs), where the luminosity produced by accretion onto the black hole outshines the stellar component. Therefore, the OBG stage offers a unique way to discriminate between light and massive initial seeds. We predict the multi-wavelength energy output of OBGs and growing Pop III remnants at a fiducial redshift (z = 9), exploring both standard and slim disk accretion onto the growing central black hole for high and low metallicities of the associated stellar population. With our computed templates, we derive the selection criteria for OBGs, that comprise a pre-selection that eliminates blue sources; followed by color-color cuts ([F\_\{070W\} - F\_\{220W\}] {\textgreater} 0; -0.3 {\textless} [F\_\{200W\} - F\_\{444W\}] {\textless} 0.3) and when available, a high ratio of X-ray flux to rest-frame optical flux (F\_X/F\_\{444W\} {\textgreater}{\textgreater} 1) (Abridged).},

	abstract = {We present cosmological, radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of galaxy formation during the epoch of reionisation in an effort towards modelling the interstellar medium (ISM) and interpreting ALMA observations. Simulations with and without stellar radiation are compared at large (Mpc), intermediate (tens of kpc), and small (sub kpc) scales to highlight the differences local stellar radiation can make for the distribution of neutral hydrogen internally to galaxy and externally on the surrounding filaments and intergalactic medium (IGM). At large scales, we find that the dense regions around galaxies reionise first before UV photons penetrate the voids; however, there remains a considerable amount of neutral gas present within the galaxies. The spatial distribution of neutral gas is highly dynamic and is anti-correlated with the presence of stars older than a few Myrs. Likewise, H\$\_2\$ masses in the galaxies are extremely time variable and sensitive to the presence of these same stars. For our specific feedback implementation, most of the metals remain inside the virial radii of galaxies and they are proportionally distributed over the ionised and neutral medium by mass. For our most massive galaxy with \$\{{\textbackslash}rm M\_h\}{\textbackslash}sim10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}\$M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, we find that the majority of the CII mass in the galaxy is associated with cold neutral clumps, similar to OI. NII is more diffuse and arises in warmer gas while OIII is associated with the hotter gas produced by photo-heating and supernovae that has a higher ionisation parameter. If small pockets of high metallicity gas exist in the ISM, the emission from these ions may be observable by ALMA while the naturally low metallicity of the galaxy will cause these systems to fall below the local [CII]-SFR relation.

	abstract = {(submitted to MNRAS January 10, 2017) We present synthetic observations for the first generations of galaxies in the Universe and make predictions for future deep field observations for redshifts greater than 6. Due to the strong impact of nebular emission lines and the relatively compact scale of HII regions, high resolution cosmological simulations and a robust suite of analysis tools are required to properly simulate spectra. We created a software pipeline consisting of FSPS, Hyperion, Cloudy and our own tools to generate synthetic IR observations from a fully three-dimensional arrangement of gas, dust, and stars. Our prescription allows us to include emission lines for a complete chemical network and tackle the effect of dust extinction and scattering in the various lines of sight. We provide spectra, 2-D binned photon imagery for both HST and JWST IR filters, luminosity relationships, and emission line strengths for a large sample of high redshift galaxies in the Renaissance Simulations (O'Shea et al. 2015). Our resulting synthetic spectra show high variability between galactic halos with a strong dependence on stellar mass, metallicity, gas mass fraction, and formation history. Halos with the lowest stellar mass have the greatest variability in [OIII]/H\${\textbackslash}beta\$, [OIII] and CIII] while halos with higher masses are seen to show consistency in their spectra and [OIII] equivalent widths (EW) between 1{\textbackslash}AA{\textbackslash} and 10{\textbackslash}AA. Viewing angle accounted for three-fold difference in flux due to the presence of ionized gas channels in a halo. Furthermore, JWST color plots show a discernible relationship between redshift, color, and mean stellar age.},

Interpreting this lack of detections is crucial to improve our understanding of high-\$z\$ supermassive black holes (SMBHs) formation and growth. In this work, we present a model for the emission of accreting BHs in the X-ray band, taking into account super-Eddington accretion, which can be very common in gas-rich systems at high-\$z\$. We compute the spectral energy distribution for a sample of active galaxies simulated in a cosmological context, which represent the progenitors of a \$z {\textbackslash}sim 6\$ SMBH with \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm BH\} {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}9 {\textbackslash}, M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$.

However, faint progenitors are still luminous enough to be detected in the X-ray band of current surveys. Even accounting for a maximum obscuration effect, the number of detectable BHs is reduced at most by a factor 2. In our simulated sample, observations of faint quasars are mainly limited by their very low active fraction (\$f\_\{{\textbackslash}rm act\} {\textbackslash}sim 1 {\textbackslash}\%\$), which is the result of short, super-critical growth episodes. We suggest that to detect high-\$z\$ SMBHs progenitors, large area surveys with shallower sensitivities, such as Cosmos Legacy and XMM-LSS+XXL, are to be preferred with respect to deep surveys probing smaller fields, such as CDF-S.},

	abstract = {The European Space Agency's Planck satellite, dedicated to studying the early Universe and its subsequent evolution, was launched 14 May 2009 and has been scanning the microwave and submillimetre sky continuously since 12 August 2009. In March 2013, ESA and the Planck Collaboration released the initial cosmology products based on the first 15.5 months of Planck data, along with a set of scientific and technical papers and a web-based explanatory supplement. This paper gives an overview of the mission and its performance, the processing, analysis, and
characteristics of the data, the scientific results, and the science data products and papers in the release. The science products include maps of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and diffuse extragalactic foregrounds, a catalogue of compact Galactic and extragalactic sources, and a list of sources detected through the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. The likelihood code used to assess cosmological models against the Planck data and a lensing likelihood are described. Scientific results include robust support for the standard six-parameter $\Lambda$CDM model of
cosmology and improved measurements of its parameters, including a highly significant deviation from scale invariance of the primordial power spectrum. The Planck values for these parameters and others derived from them are significantly different from those previously determined. Several large-scale anomalies in the temperature
distribution of the CMB, first detected by WMAP, are confirmed with higher confidence. Planck sets new limits on the number and mass of neutrinos, and has measured gravitational lensing of CMB anisotropies at greater than 25$\sigma$. Planck finds no evidence for non-Gaussianity in the CMB. Planck's results agree well with results from the measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations. Planck finds a lower Hubble constant than found in some more local measures. Some tension is also present between the amplitude of matter fluctuations ($\sigma$8)
derived from CMB data and that derived from Sunyaev-Zeldovich data. The Planck and WMAP power spectra are offset from each other by an average level of about 2\% around the first acoustic peak. Analysis of Planck polarization data is not yet mature, therefore polarization results are not released, although the robust detection of E-mode polarization around CMB hot and cold spots is shown graphically.},

We demonstrate that the emission from faint unresolved satellite sources, \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm UV\} {\textbackslash}gtrsim -17\$, clustered around the central galaxies may play a major role in generating spatially extended Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$, continuum (\$\{{\textbackslash}rm UV + VIS\}\$) and H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ halos. We apply the analytic formalism developed in Mas-ribas \& Dijkstra (2016) to model the halos around Lyman Alpha Emitters (LAEs) at \$z=3.1\$, for several different satellite clustering prescriptions. In general, our UV and Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ surface brightness profiles match the observations well at \$20{\textbackslash}lesssim r {\textbackslash}lesssim 40\$ physical kpc from the centers of LAEs. We discuss how our profiles depend on various model assumptions and how these can be tested and constrained with future H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ observations by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Our analysis shows how spatially extended halos constrain (i) the presence of otherwise undetectable satellite sources, (ii) the integrated, volumetric production rates of Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ and LyC photons, and (iii) their population-averaged escape fractions. These quantities are all directly relevant for understanding galaxy formation and evolution and, for high enough redshifts, cosmic reionization.},

	abstract = {We study the nature of rapidly star-forming galaxies at z=2 in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, and compare their properties to observations of sub-millimetre galaxies (SMGs). We identify simulated SMGs as the most rapidly star-forming systems that match the observed number density of SMGs. In our models, SMGs are massive galaxies sitting at the centres of large potential wells, being fed by smooth infall and gas-rich satellites at rates comparable to their star formation rates (SFR). They are not typically undergoing major mergers that significantly boost their quiescent SFR, but they still often show complex gas morphologies and kinematics. Our simulated SMGs have stellar masses of log M*/Mo{\textasciitilde}11-11.7, SFRs of {\textasciitilde}180-500 Mo/yr, a clustering length of 10 Mpc/h, and solar metallicities. The SFRs are lower than those inferred from far-IR data by a factor of 3, which we suggest may owe to one or more systematic effects in the SFR calibrations. SMGs at z=2 live in {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}13 Mo halos, and by z=0 they mostly end up as brightest group galaxies in {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}14 Mo halos. We predict that higher-M* SMGs should have on average lower specific SFRs, less disturbed morphologies, and higher clustering. We also predict that deeper far-IR surveys will smoothly join SMGs onto the massive end of the SFR-M* relationship defined by lower-mass z=2 galaxies. Overall, our simulated rapid star-formers provide as good a match to available SMG data as merger-based scenarios, offering an alternative scenario that emerges naturally from cosmological simulations.},

	abstract = {The first billion years of the Universe is a pivotal time: stars, black holes (BHs) and galaxies form and assemble, sowing the seeds of galaxies as we know them today. Detecting, identifying and understand- ing the first galaxies and BHs is one of the current observational and theoretical challenges in galaxy formation. In this paper we present a population synthesis model aimed at galaxies, BHs and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) at high redshift. The model builds a population based on empirical relations. Galaxies are characterized by a spectral energy distribution determined by age and metallicity, and AGNs by a spectral energy distribution determined by BH mass and accretion rate. We validate the model against observational constraints, and then predict properties of galaxies and AGN in other wavelength and/or luminosity ranges, estimating the contamination of stellar populations (normal stars and high-mass X-ray binaries) for AGN searches from the infrared to X-rays, and vice-versa for galaxy searches. For high-redshift galaxies, with stellar ages {\textless} 1 Gyr, we find that disentangling stellar and AGN emission is challenging at restframe UV/optical wavelengths, while high-mass X-ray binaries become more important sources of confusion in X-rays. We propose a color-color selection in JWST bands to separate AGN vs star-dominated galaxies in photometric observations. We also esti- mate the AGN contribution, with respect to massive, hot, metal-poor stars, at driving high ionization lines, such as C IV and He II. Finally, we test the influence of the minimum BH mass and occupa- tion fraction of BHs in low mass galaxies on the restframe UV/near-IR and X-ray AGN luminosity function.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01769},
	abstract = {To understand the evolution of extinction curve, we calculate the dust evolution in a galaxy using smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations incorporating stellar dust production, dust destruction in supernova shocks, grain growth by accretion and coagulation, and grain disruption by shattering. The dust species are separated into carbonaceous dust and silicate. The evolution of grain size distribution is considered by dividing grain population into large and small gains, which allows us to estimate extinction curves. We examine the dependence of extinction curves on the position, gas density, and metallicity in the galaxy, and find that extinction curves are flat at \$t {\textbackslash}lesssim 0.3\$ Gyr because stellar dust production dominates the total dust abundance. The 2175 {\textbackslash}AA{\textbackslash} bump and far-ultraviolet (FUV) rise become prominent after dust growth by accretion. At \$t {\textbackslash}gtrsim 3\$ Gyr, shattering works efficiently in the outer disc and low density regions, so extinction curves show a very strong 2175 {\textbackslash}AA{\textbackslash} bump and steep FUV rise. The extinction curves at \$t{\textbackslash}gtrsim 3\$ Gyr are consistent with the Milky Way extinction curve, which implies that we successfully included the necessary dust processes in the model. The outer disc component caused by stellar feedback has an extinction curves with a weaker 2175 {\textbackslash}AA{\textbackslash} bump and flatter FUV slope. The strong contribution of carbonaceous dust tends to underproduce the FUV rise in the Small Magellanic Cloud extinction curve, which supports selective loss of small carbonaceous dust in the galaxy. The snapshot at young ages also explain the extinction curves in high-redshift quasars.},

	abstract = {We present the results of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with zoom-in initial conditions, and investigate the formation of the first galaxies and their evolution towards observable galaxies at \$z {\textbackslash}sim 6\$. We focus on three different galaxies which end up in halos with masses \$M\_\{h\} = 2.4 {\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}{\textasciitilde}h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textbackslash}; M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ (Halo-10), \$1.6 {\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}{\textasciitilde}h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textbackslash}; M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ (Halo-11) and \$0.7 {\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{12\}{\textasciitilde}h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ (Halo-12) at z=6. Our simulations also probe impacts of different sub-grid assumptions, i.e., SF efficiency and cosmic reionization, on SF histories in the first galaxies. We find that star formation occurs intermittently due to supernova (SN) feedback at z {\textgreater} 10, and then it proceeds more smoothly as the halo mass grows at lower redshifts. Galactic disks are destroyed due to SN feedback, while galaxies in simulations with no-feedback or lower SF efficiency models can sustain galactic disk for long periods {\textgreater} 10 Myr. The expulsion of gas at the galactic center also affects the inner dark matter density profile. However, SN feedback does not seem to keep the shallow profile of dark matter for a long period. Our simulated galaxies in Halo-11 and Halo-12 reproduce the star formation rates (SFR) and stellar masses of observed Lyman-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ emitters (LAEs) at z = 7-8 fairly well given observational uncertainties. In addition, we investigate the effect of UV background radiation on star formation as an external feedback source, and find that earlier reionization extends the quenching time of star formation due to photo-ionization heating, but does not affect the stellar mass at z=6.},

	abstract = {Modeling galaxy formation in a cosmological context presents one of the greatest challenges in astrophysics today, due to the vast range of scales and numerous physical processes involved. Here we review the current status of models that employ two leading techniques to simulate the physics of galaxy formation: semi-analytic models and numerical hydrodynamic simulations. We focus on a set of observational targets that describe the evolution of the global and structural properties of galaxies from roughly Cosmic High Noon (\$z{\textbackslash}sim 2-3\$) to the present. Although minor discrepancies remain, overall, models show remarkable convergence between different methods and make predictions that are in qualitative agreement with observations. Modelers seem to have converged on a core set of physical processes that are critical for shaping galaxy properties. This core set includes cosmological accretion, strong stellar-driven winds that are more efficient at low masses, black hole feedback that preferentially suppresses star formation at high masses, and structural and morphological evolution through merging and environmental processes. However, all cosmological models currently adopt phenomenological implementations of many of these core processes, which must be tuned to observations. Many details of how these diverse processes interact within a hierarchical structure formation setting remain poorly understood. Emerging multi-scale simulations are helping to bridge the gap between stellar and cosmological scales, placing models on a firmer, more physically grounded footing. Concurrently, upcoming telescope facilities will provide new challenges and constraints for models, particularly by directly constraining inflows and outflows through observations of gas in and around galaxies.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05063},
	abstract = {Imaging with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will allow for observing the bulk of distant galaxies at the epoch of reionisation. The recovery of their properties, such as age, color excess E(B-V), specific star formation rate (sSFR) and stellar mass, will mostly rely on spectral energy distribution fitting, based on the data provided by JWST's two imager cameras, namely the Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and the Mid Infrared Imager (MIRI). In this work we analyze the effect of choosing different combinations of NIRCam and MIRI broad-band filters, from 0.6 \{{\textbackslash}mu\}m to 7.7 \{{\textbackslash}mu\}m, on the recovery of these galaxy properties. We performed our tests on a sample of 1542 simulated galaxies, with known input properties, at z=7-10. We found that, with only 8 NIRCam broad-bands, we can recover the galaxy age within 0.1 Gyr and the color excess within 0.06 mag for 70\% of the galaxies. Besides, the stellar masses and sSFR are recovered within 0.2 and 0.3 dex, respectively, at z=7-9. Instead, at z=10, no NIRCam band traces purely the \{{\textbackslash}lambda\}{\textgreater} 4000 \{{\textbackslash}AA\} regime and the percentage of outliers in stellar mass (sSFR) increases by {\textgreater} 20\% ({\textgreater} 90\%), in comparison to z=9. The MIRI F560W and F770W bands are crucial to improve the stellar mass and the sSFR estimation at z=10. When nebular emission lines are present, deriving correct galaxy properties is challenging, at any redshift and with any band combination. In particular, the stellar mass is systematically overestimated in up to 0.3 dex on average with NIRCam data alone and including MIRI observations improves only marginally the estimation.},

	abstract = {We present a suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations at z{\textgreater}5 from the Feedback In Realistic Environments project, spanning a halo mass range M\_halo{\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}8-10{\textasciicircum}12 M\_sun at z=5. We predict the stellar mass-halo mass relation, stellar mass function, and luminosity function in several bands from z=5-12. The median stellar mass-halo mass relation does not evolve strongly at z=5-12. The faint-end slope of the luminosity function steepens with increasing redshift, as inherited from the halo mass function at these redshifts. Below z{\textasciitilde}6, the stellar mass function and ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function slightly flatten below M\_star{\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}4.5 M\_sun (fainter than M\_1500{\textasciitilde}-14), owing to the fact that star formation in low-mass halos is suppressed by the ionizing background by the end of reionization. Such flattening does not appear at higher redshifts. We provide redshift-dependent fitting functions for the SFR-M\_halo, SFR-M\_star, and broad-band magnitude-stellar mass relations. We derive the star formation rate density and stellar mass density at z=5-12 and show that the contribution from very faint galaxies becomes more important at z{\textgreater}8. Furthermore, we find that the decline in the z{\textasciitilde}6 UV luminosity function brighter than M\_1500{\textasciitilde}-20 is largely due to dust attenuation. Approximately 37\% (54\%) of the UV luminosity from galaxies brighter than M\_1500=-13 (-17) is obscured by dust at z{\textasciitilde}6. Our results broadly agree with current data and can be tested by future observations.},

	abstract = {We present ALMA observations of the dust continuum and [C II] 158um line emission from the z=6.0695 Lyman Break Galaxy WMH5. These observations at 0.3" spatial resolution show a compact ({\textasciitilde}3kpc) main galaxy in dust and [C II] emission, with a 'tail' of emission extending to the east by about 5kpc (in projection). The [C II] tail is comprised predominantly of two distinct sub-components in velocity, separated from the core by {\textasciitilde}100 and 250km/s, with narrow intrinsic widths of about 80km/s, which we call 'sub-galaxies'. The sub-galaxies themselves are extended east-west by about 3kpc in individual channel images. The [C II] tail joins smoothly into the main galaxy velocity field. The [C II] line to continuum ratios are comparable for the main and sub-galaxy positions, within a factor 2. In addition, these ratios are comparable to z{\textasciitilde}5.5 LBGs. We conjecture that the WMH5 system represents the early formation of a galaxy through the accretion of smaller satellite galaxies, embedded in a smoother gas distribution, along a possibly filamentary structure. The results are consistent with current cosmological
simulations of early galaxy formation, and support the idea of very early enrichment with dust and heavy elements of the accreting material.},

For z 2 galaxies with moderate luminosities ( L 8 $\mu$m {\textless} 10 11 L ? ), we find that the SFR can be estimated consistently from the multiwavelength data based on local luminosity correlations. However, 20\%-30\% of massive galaxies, and nearly all those with L 8 $\mu$m {\textgreater} 10 11 L ? , show a mid-IR excess that is likely due to the presence of obscured active nuclei, as shown in a companion paper. There is a tight and roughly linear correlation between stellar mass and SFR for 24 $\mu$m-detected galaxies. For a given mass, the SFR at z = 2 was larger by a factor of 4 and 30 relative to that in star-forming galaxies at z = 1 and 0, respectively. Typical ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) at z = 2 are relatively "transparent" to ultraviolet light, and their activity is long lived ( \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gtrsim.gif] gtrsim 400 Myr), unlike that in local ULIRGs and high-redshift submillimeter-selected galaxies. ULIRGs are the common mode of star formation in massive galaxies at z = 2, and the high duty cycle suggests that major mergers are not the dominant trigger for this activity. Current galaxy formation models underpredict the normalization of the mass-SFR correlation by about a factor of 4 and the space density of ULIRGs by an order of magnitude but give better agreement for z {\textgreater} 1.4 quiescent galaxies.},

We find that H-alpha emitters are located in the outskirts of the density peak (cluster core) dominated by passive red-sequence galaxies. This resembles the situation in lower-redshift clusters, suggesting that the newly discovered structure is a well-evolved rich galaxy cluster at z=1.5. Our data suggest that the color-density and stellar mass-density relations are already in place at z{\textasciitilde}1.5, mostly driven by the passive red massive galaxies residing within Rc{\textless}200 kpc from the cluster core. These environmental trends almost disappear when we consider only star-forming (SF) galaxies. We do not find SFR-density or SSFR-density relations amongst SF galaxies, and the location of the SF main sequence does not significantly change with environment. Nevertheless, we find a tentative hint that star-bursting galaxies (up-scattered objects from the main sequence) are preferentially located in a small group at {\textasciitilde}1-Mpc away from the main body of the cluster. We also argue that the scatter of the SF main sequence could be dependent on the distance to the nearest neighboring galaxy.},

Our fiducial (50 Mpc/h){\textasciicircum}3 volume is evolved to z=0 with a quarter billion particles, The predicted galaxy stellar mass functions (GSMF) reproduce observations from z=4-0 to {\textless}1.2sigma in cosmic variance, providing an unprecedented match to this key diagnostic. The cosmic star formation history and stellar mass growth show general agreement with data, with a strong archaeological downsizing trend such that dwarf galaxies form the majority of their stars after z{\textasciitilde}1. We run 25 Mpc/h and 12.5 Mpc/h volumes to z=2 with identical feedback prescriptions, the latter resolving all hydrogen-cooling halos, and the three runs display fair resolution convergence. The specific star formation rates broadly agree with data at z=0, but are underpredicted at z{\textasciitilde}2 by a factor of three, re-emphasizing a longstanding puzzle in galaxy evolution models. We compare runs using MFM and two flavours of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics, and show that the GSMF is sensitive to hydrodynamics methodology at the {\textasciitilde}x2 level, which is sub-dominant to choices for parameterising feedback.},

Furthermore, we derive distribution functions of H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ luminosity and stellar mass in group and intergroup regions, approximately corresponding to 30 times and 8 times higher densities than the general field. As a consequence, we identify by 0.7 and 0.9 dex higher cutoffs in H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ luminosity and stellar mass functions in the dense groups, respectively. On the other hand, HAEs in the intergroup environment of the protocluster show similar distribution functions to those of field galaxies despite residing in significant overdensities. In the early phase of cluster formation, as inferred from our results, the densest parts in the protocluster have had an accelerated formation of massive galaxies. We expect that these eventually grow and transform into early-type galaxies at the bright end of the red sequence as seen in present-day rich clusters of galaxies.},

In addition, we present a compilation of UV, IR and H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ SFRFs and compare these with the predictions from the EAGLE suite of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. We find that the constraints implied by different indicators are inconsistent with each other for the highest star-forming objects at z {\textless} 2, a problem that is possibly related to selection biases and the uncertainties of dust attenuation effects. EAGLE's feedback parameters were calibrated to reproduce realistic galaxy sizes and stellar masses at z = 0.1. In this work we test if and why those choices yield realistic Star Formation Rates (SFRs) for \$z {\textbackslash}sim 0-8\$ as well. We demonstrate that SNe feedback plays a major role at setting the abundance of galaxies at all star-forming regimes, especially at high redshifts. On the contrary, Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback becomes more prominent at lower redshifts and is a major mechanism that affects only the highest star-forming systems. Furthermore, we find that galaxies with SFR \${\textbackslash}sim 1-10 {\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\} {\textbackslash}, yr{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$ dominate the CSFRD at redshifts z {\textless} 5, while rare high star-forming galaxies (SFR \${\textbackslash}sim 10-100 {\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\} {\textbackslash}, yr{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$) contribute significantly only briefly around the peak era (\$z {\textbackslash}sim 2\$) and then are quenched by AGN feedback. In the absence of this prescription objects with SFR \${\textbackslash}sim 10-100 {\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\} {\textbackslash}, yr{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$ would dominate the CSFRD, while the cosmic budget of star formation would be extremely high.

These protoclusters are promising candidates for the most massive class of galaxy clusters seen today (Paper I). The confirmed HAEs in the protoclusters at \$z{\textgreater}2\$ show high excitation levels as characterized by much higher [OIII]/H\${\textbackslash}beta\$ or [OIII]/H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ line ratios than those of general galaxies at low-\$z\$. Such a high excitation level may not only be driven by high specific star formation rates (sSFRs) and lower gaseous metallicities, but also be contributed by some other effects. We investigate the environmental dependence of gaseous metallicities by comparing the HAEs in the protoclusters with those in the general field at similar redshifts. We find that the gaseous metallicities of protocluster galaxies are more chemically enriched than those of field galaxies at a given stellar mass in the range of M\$\_{\textbackslash}star{\textbackslash}lesssim10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}\$ M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$. This can be attributed to many processes, such as intrinsic (or nature) effects, external (or nurture) effects, and/or some systematic sampling effects. We also find that the offset of the mass-metallicity relation in dense environment becomes larger at higher redshifts. This can be naturally understood by the fact that the in/out-flow rates in star forming galaxies are much higher at higher redshifts. Therefore the environmental dependence of such "feeding" and "feedback" mechanisms in galaxy formation are probably playing major roles in producing the offset of the mass-metallicity relation for the protocluster galaxies at \$z{\textgreater}2\$.},

We investigate the implications of this fundamental change in a cosmological context using a set of N -body simulations and semi-analytic models. We find that the fraction of the cosmic volume occupied by all (proto)clusters increases by nearly three orders of magnitude from z = 0 to z = 7. We show that (proto)cluster galaxies are an important and even dominant population at high redshift, as their expected contribution to the cosmic star formation rate density rises (from 1\% at z = 0) to 20\% at z = 2 and 50\% at z = 10. Protoclusters thus provide a significant fraction of the cosmic ionizing photons, and may have been crucial in driving the timing and topology of cosmic reionization. Internally, the average history of cluster formation can be described by three distinct phases: at z \~{} 10{\textendash}5, galaxy growth in protoclusters proceeded in an inside-out manner, with centrally dominant halos that are among the most active regions in the universe; at z \~{} 5{\textendash}1.5, rapid star formation occurred within the entire 10{\textendash}20 Mpc structures, forming most of their present-day stellar mass; at z ? 1.5, violent gravitational collapse drove these stellar contents into single cluster halos, largely erasing the details of cluster galaxy formation due to relaxation and virialization. Our results motivate observations of distant protoclusters in order to understand the rapid, extended stellar growth during cosmic noon, and their connection to reionization during cosmic dawn.},

By comparing physical information extracted from the emission lines with continuum properties, we build up a picture of the nature of star-forming galaxies at z {\textless} 0.2. We develop a
method for aperture correction using resolved imaging and show that our method takes out essentially all aperture bias in the star formation rate (SFR) estimates, allowing an accurate estimate of the total SFRs in galaxies. We determine the SFR density to be

(random)+0.14-0.42 (systematic)
h7010-2 Msolar yr-1
Mpc-3 at z= 0.1 (for a Kroupa initial mass function) and we study the distribution of star formation as a function of various physical parameters. The majority of the star formation in the
low-redshift Universe takes place in moderately massive galaxies (1010-1011 Msolar), typically in high surface brightness disc galaxies. Roughly 15 per cent of all star formation takes place in galaxies that show some sign of an active nucleus. About 20 per cent occurs in starburst galaxies. By focusing on the SFR per unit mass we show that the present to past average SFR, the Scalo b-parameter, is almost constant over almost three orders of magnitude in mass, declining only at M* {\textgreater} 1010 Msolar. The volume averaged b parameter is
0.408+0.005-0.002

cosmology the present-day Universe is forming stars at at least 1/3 of its past average rate. For an exponentially declining cosmic star formation history this corresponds to a time-scale of
7+0.7-1.5 Gyr. In agreement with other work we find a correlation between b and morphological type, as well as a tight correlation between the 4000-{\r A}break (D4000) and b. We discuss how D4000 can be used to estimate b parameters for high-redshift galaxies.},

	abstract = {The relationship between galaxy star formation rates (SFRs) and stellar masses ( M * ) is reexamined using a mass-selected sample of 62,000 star-forming galaxies at z <= 1.3 in the COSMOS 2 deg 2 field. Using new far-infrared photometry from Herschel -PACS and SPIRE and Spitzer -MIPS 24 $\mu$m, along with derived infrared luminosities from the NRK method based on galaxies' locations in the restframe color-color diagram (NUV {\textendash} r ) versus ( r {\textendash} K ), we are able to more accurately determine total SFRs for our complete sample. At all redshifts, the relationship between median SFR and M * follows a power law at low stellar masses, and flattens to nearly constant SFR at high stellar masses. We describe a new parameterization that provides the best fit to the main sequence and characterizes the low mass power-law slope, turnover mass, and overall scaling. The turnover in the main sequence occurs at a characteristic mass of about M 0 10 10 M ? at all redshifts. The low mass power-law slope ranges from 0.9-1.3 and the overall scaling rises in SFR as a function of (1 + z ) 4.12 {\textpm} 0.10 .

It is the first time that these relations can be followed over such a large redshift range from a single homogeneously selected sample of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts. The log ({\textless}i{\textgreater}SFR{\textless}i/{\textgreater}) - log ({\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}{\textless}i{\textgreater}*{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}) relation for SFGs remains roughly linear all the way up to {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 5, but the SFR steadily increases at fixed mass with increasing redshift.

We interpret this turn-off as the signature of a strong on-going quenching mechanism and rapid mass growth.

We find that the shape of the sSFR evolution is not well reproduced by cold gas accretion-driven models or the latest hydrodynamical models. Below {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textasciitilde} 2 these models have a flatter evolution (1 + {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater}){\textless}sup{\textgreater}$\Phi${\textless}sup/{\textgreater} with $\Phi$ = 2 - 2.25 compared to the data which evolves more rapidly with $\Phi$ = 2.8 {\textpm} 0.2. Above {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textasciitilde} 2, the reverse is happening with the data evolving more slowly with $\Phi$ = 1.2 {\textpm} 0.1. The observed sSFR evolution over a large redshift range 0 {\textless}{\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless} 5 and our finding of a non-linear main sequence at high mass both indicate that the evolution of SFR and {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}{\textless}i{\textgreater}*{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} is not solely driven by gas accretion. The results presented in this paper emphasize the need to invoke a more complex mix of physical processes including major and minor merging to further understand the co-evolution of the SFR and stellar mass growth.},

We show that a transition in the slope of the star-forming sequence, such that $\alpha$ = 1 at log ( M / M ? ) 10.5, greatly improves agreement with the evolution of the stellar mass function. We then derive a star-forming sequence that reproduces the evolution of the mass function by design. This star-forming sequence is also well described by a broken power law, with a shallow slope at high masses and a steep slope at low masses. At z = 2, it is offset by 0.3 dex from the observed star-forming sequence, consistent with the mild disagreement between the cosmic star formation rate (SFR) and recent observations of the growth of the stellar mass density. It is unclear whether this problem stems from errors in stellar mass estimates, errors in SFRs, or other effects. We show that a mass-dependent slope is also seen in other self-consistent models of galaxy evolution, including semianalytical, hydrodynamical, and abundance-matching models. As part of the analysis, we demonstrate that neither mergers nor hidden low-mass quiescent galaxies are likely to reconcile the evolution of the mass function and the star-forming sequence.

a dark mass resolution of 6.26 {\texttimes} 106 M?,
and an initial baryonic matter mass resolution of 1.26 {\texttimes}
106 M?. At z = 0 gravitational forces are
softened on scales of 710 pc, and the smallest hydrodynamical gas cells
have an extent of 48 pc. We follow the dynamical evolution of 2 {\texttimes}
18203 resolution elements and in addition passively evolve
18203 Monte Carlo tracer particles reaching a total particle
count of more than 18 billion. The galaxy formation model includes:
primordial and metal-line cooling with self-shielding corrections,
stellar evolution, stellar feedback, gas recycling, chemical enrichment,
supermassive black hole growth, and feedback from active galactic
nuclei. Here we describe the simulation suite, and contrast basic
predictions of our model for the present-day galaxy population with
observations of the local universe. At z = 0 our simulation volume
contains about 40 000 well-resolved galaxies covering a diverse range of
morphologies and colours including early-type, late-type and irregular
galaxies. The simulation reproduces reasonably well the cosmic star
formation rate density, the galaxy luminosity function, and baryon
conversion efficiency at z = 0. It also qualitatively captures the
impact of galaxy environment on the red fractions of galaxies. The
internal velocity structure of selected well-resolved disc galaxies
obeys the stellar and baryonic Tully-Fisher relation together with flat
circular velocity curves. In the well-resolved regime, the simulation
reproduces the observed mix of early-type and late-type galaxies. Our
model predicts a halo mass dependent impact of baryonic effects on the
halo mass function and the masses of haloes caused by feedback from
supernova and active galactic nuclei.},

Gravitational lensing combined with deep HST observations allows us to extend the analysis of the MS down to \{log\} M/\{M\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}? {\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}? 7.5 at z? 4 and \{log\} M/\{M\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}? {\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}? 8 at higher redshifts, a factor of ?10 below most previous results. We perform an accurate simulation to take into account the effect of observational uncertainties and correct for the Eddington bias. This step allows us to reliably measure the MS and in particular its slope. While the normalization increases with redshift, we fit an unevolving and approximately linear slope. We nicely extend to lower masses the results of brighter surveys. Thanks to the large dynamic range in mass and by making use of the simulation, we analyzed any possible mass dependence of the dispersion around the MS. We find tentative evidence that the scatter decreases with increasing mass, suggesting a larger variety of star formation histories in low-mass galaxies. This trend agrees with theoretical predictions and is explained as either a consequence of the smaller number of progenitors of low-mass galaxies in a hierarchical scenario and/or of the efficient but intermittent stellar feedback processes in low-mass halos. Finally, we observe an increase in the SFR per unit stellar mass with redshift milder than predicted by theoretical models, implying a still incomplete understanding of the processes responsible for galaxy growth.},

Based on a sample of 261 galaxies with H $\alpha$ and H $\beta$ spectroscopy, we have estimated robust dust-corrected instantaneous SFRs over a large range in M * (\~{}10 9.5 {\textendash}10 11.5 M ? ).

Our sample is immune from these biases as it is rest-frame optically selected, H $\alpha$ and H $\beta$ are corrected for Balmer absorption, and the H $\alpha$ luminosity is dust corrected using the nebular color excess computed from the Balmer decrement. The scatter of the log(SFR(H $\alpha$ )){\textendash}log( M * ) relation, after accounting for the measurement uncertainties, is 0.31 dex at 2.1 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.6, which is 0.05 dex larger than the scatter in log(SFR(UV)){\textendash}log( M * ). Based on comparisons to a simulated SFR{\textendash} M * relation with some intrinsic scatter, we argue that in the absence of direct measurements of galaxy-to-galaxy variations in the attenuation/extinction curves and the initial mass function, one cannot use the difference in the scatter of the SFR(H $\alpha$ ){\textendash} and SFR(UV){\textendash} M * relations to constrain the stochasticity of star formation in high-redshift galaxies.},

three-dimensional Monte Carlo dust radiative transfer code to study dust
extinction, dust emission, and dust temperature within these simulated
z{\textgreater}=5 galaxies. Our sample forms a tight correlation between infrared
excess (IRX=F\_IR/F\_UV) and ultraviolet (UV)-continuum slope (beta\_UV),
despite the patchy, clumpy dust geometry shown in our simulations. We
find that the IRX-beta\_UV relation is mainly determined by the shape of
the extinction curve and is independent of its normalization (set by the
dust-to-gas ratio). The bolometric IR luminosity (L\_IR) correlates with
the intrinsic UV luminosity and the star formation rate (SFR) averaged
over the past 10 Myr. We predict that at a given L\_IR, the peak
wavelength of the dust spectral energy distributions for z{\textgreater}=5
galaxies is smaller by a factor of 2 (due to higher dust temperatures on
average) than at z=0. The higher dust temperatures are driven by higher
specific SFRs and SFR surface densities with increasing redshift. We
derive the galaxy UV luminosity functions (LFs) at z=5-10 from our
simulations and confirm that a heavy attenuation is required to
reproduce the observed bright-end UVLFs. We also predict the IRLFs and

scales with UV luminosity as \$R\_e{\textbackslash}propto L\_\{{\textbackslash}textrm\{UV\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{0.33\}\$ at
\$z=5\$-\$10\$, and with stellar mass as \$R\_e{\textbackslash}propto M\_{\textbackslash}ast{\textasciicircum}\{0.24\}\$ at \$z=5\$

that the median galaxy size scales with redshift as \$R\_e {\textbackslash}propto
(1+z){\textasciicircum}\{-m\}\$, where \$m=1.98{\textbackslash}pm0.07\$ for galaxies with

halo specific angular momentum is typically less than one and decreases
with halo and stellar mass. This relation shows no redshift dependence,
while the relation between specific angular momentum and stellar mass
decreases by \${\textbackslash}sim0.5\$ dex from \$z=7\$ to \$2\$. Our model reproduces the
distribution of local galaxy morphologies, with bulges formed
predominantly through galaxy mergers for low-mass galaxies,
disc-instabilities for galaxies with

These steeper low-mass slopes are found for three different star formation indicators: the combination of the ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR), calibrated from a stacking analysis of Spitzer/MIPS 24 $\mu$m imaging; $\beta$-corrected UV SFRs; and H$\alpha$ SFRs. The normalization of the sequence evolves differently in distinct mass regimes as well: for galaxies less massive than log (M */M ?) {\textless} 10 the specific SFR ($\Psi$/M *) is observed to be roughly self-similar with $\Psi$/M *?(1 + z)1.9, whereas more massive galaxies show a stronger evolution with $\Psi$/M *?(1 + z)2.2-3.5 for log (M */M ?) = 10.2-11.2.

In this paper we employ the EAGLE simulations to study the dependence of the \$\{{\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{sSFR\}\}\}\$ of galaxies on stellar mass (\$\{{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}\}\$) through the \$\{{\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{sSFR\}\}\}\$-\$\{{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}\}\$ relation in \$ \{{\textbackslash}rm z {\textbackslash}sim 0-4\}\$. We find that the relation evolves with time, with the dispersion depending on both stellar mass and redshift. The models point to an evolving U-shape form for the \$\{{\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{sSFR\}\}\}\$-\$\{{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}\}\$ relation with the scatter being minimal at a characteristic mass \$M{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}star\}\$ of \$\{{\textbackslash}rm 10{\textasciicircum}\{9.5\}\}\$ \$\{{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\}\$ and increasing both at lower and higher masses. This implication is that the diversity of SFHs increases towards both at the low- and high-mass ends. We find that active galactic nuclei feedback is important for increasing the \$\{{\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{sSFR\}\}\}\$ for high mass objects. On the other hand, we suggest that SNe feedback increases the \$\{{\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{sSFR\}\}\}\$ of galaxies at the low-mass end. We also find that excluding galaxies that have experienced recent mergers does not significantly affect the \$\{{\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{sSFR\}\}\}\$-\$\{{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}\}\$ relation. Furthermore, we employ the combination of the EAGLE simulations with the radiative transfer code SKIRT to evaluate the effect of SFR/stellar mass diagnostics in the \$\{{\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{sSFR\}\}\}\$-\$\{{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}\}\$ relation and find that the \$\{{\textbackslash}rm SFR/M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}\}\$ methodologies (e.g. SED fitting, UV+IR, UV+IRX-\${\textbackslash}beta\$) widely used in the literature to obtain intrinsic properties of galaxies have a large effect on the derived shape and normalization of the \$\{{\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{sSFR\}\}\}\$-\$\{{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}\}\$ relation.},

We calculate the X-ray properties in a manner consistent with observational techniques, demonstrating the bias and scatter introduced by using estimated masses. We find the total stellar content and black hole masses of the clusters to be in good agreement with the observed relations. However, the clusters are too gas rich, suggesting that the active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback model is not efficient enough at expelling gas from the high-redshift progenitors of the clusters. The X-ray properties, such as the spectroscopic temperature and the soft-band luminosity, and the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich properties are in reasonable agreement with the observed relations. However, the clusters have too high central temperatures and larger-than-observed entropy cores, which is likely driven by the AGN feedback after the cluster core has formed. The total metal content and its distribution throughout the intracluster medium are a good match to the observations.},

This scale is valid over a range of redshifts and selection criteria. We present a procedure for estimating, given a measured galaxy overdensity, the protocluster probability and its descendant cluster mass for a range of modelling assumptions,
particularly taking into account the shape of the measurement aperture. This procedure produces lower protocluster probabilities compared to previous estimates using fixed size apertures. The relationship between active galactic nucleus (AGN) and protoclusters is also investigated and shows significant evolution with redshift; at z \~{} 2, the fraction of protoclusters traced by AGN is high, but the fraction of all AGNs in protoclusters is low, whereas at z >= 5 the fraction of protoclusters containing AGN is low, but most AGNs are in protoclusters. We also find indirect evidence for the emergence of a passive sequence in
protoclusters at z \~{} 2, and note that a significant fraction of
all galaxies reside in protoclusters at z >= 2, particularly the most massive.},

	abstract = {Next generation observatories will enable us to study the first billion 
years of our Universe in unprecedented detail. Foremost among these are
21-cm interferometry with the HERA and the SKA, and high-\$z\$ galaxy
observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Taking a basic
galaxy model, in which we allow the star formation rates and ionizing
escape fractions to have a power-law dependence on halo mass with an
exponential turnover below some threshold, we quantify how observations
from these instruments can be used to constrain the astrophysics of
high-\$z\$ galaxies. For this purpose, we generate mock JWST LFs, based on
two different hydrodynamical cosmological simulations; these have
intrinsic luminosity functions (LFs) which turn over at different scales
and yet are fully consistent with present-day observations. We also
generate mock 21-cm power spectrum observations, using 1000h
observations with SKA1 and a moderate foreground model. Using only JWST
data, we predict up to a factor of 2-3 improvement (compared with HST)
in the fractional uncertainty of the star formation rate to halo mass
relation and the scales at which the LFs peak (i.e. turnover). Most
parameters regulating the UV galaxy properties can be constrained at the
level of \${\textbackslash}sim 10\$\% or better, if either (i) we are able to better
characterize systematic lensing uncertainties than currently possible;
or (ii) the intrinsic LFs peak at magnitudes brighter than \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm UV\}
{\textbackslash}lesssim -13\$. Otherwise, improvement over HST-based inference is
modest. When combining with upcoming 21-cm observations, we are able to
significantly mitigate degeneracies, and constrain all of our
astrophysical parameters, even for our most pessimistic assumptions
about upcoming JWST LFs. The 21-cm observations also result in an order
of magnitude improvement in constraints on the EoR history.},
